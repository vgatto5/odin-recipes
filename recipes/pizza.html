        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
            <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
            <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.</li>
            <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
        </ol>
